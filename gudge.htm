    <h1>The Life of Gudge</h1>
    <p>Gudge is a little guy. He comes from the big city of Guagagagoop, on a journey to travel the world.
 His current stop is the small town of Jelm, Worshingrag. One day, while he was passing by a short strip of shops, a large storm started brewing overhead.
 Gudge was so frightened by the thought of being stuck in rain that this, to him, was enough to be classified as a typhoon.
 Because of the overwhelming fear that he would be swept away by the oncoming storm, he decided to take shelter in one of the shops in the strip.
